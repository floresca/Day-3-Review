Take Aways:

So far in the last 2 weeks of class I have realized that if I just push through the content I can acheive the goals i've set to myself. I feel that I can actually do this. I've realized that with the upcoming trip I could be in a very bad position and even fall way behind. I refuse to let that happen. My peers have agreed to help and we will all keep in touch to further develop all our skills.

What started as a solo journey a few months ago feels now like a team effort. I have keep learning and find out multiple ways to solve and achieve our target spectations and really look forward to the challenges ahead.

I am slowly starting to breathe this new life that I am crafting. I wake up thinking of the things I want to try to solve the problems presented in this class, I sleep late trying to achieve new milestones for myself.

If this is what I've taken so far in two weeks of time, can you imagine in a month? 2 months? let alone 9 months?
