Goals:

My goal as a developer is to gain and employ the tools needed to aid in the growth of STEM in innercity communities. I grew up in such a community and know first hand the huge divide between such communities and their ability to grow in STEM.

I want to be able to develop and deploy easy to use programs that allow parents to familiarize themselves with the mayor issues which can prevent upward mobility in a disenfranchised community: Poor STEM education, poor community engagement, Lack of knowledge of parenting resources, lack of knowledge of educational opporunities.

programs and ideas:
-Programs that connect parents to education in any language of choice
	-Local school department meeting minutes
	-Open houses
	-Free educational events happening around them
	-PTA meeting times and discussiong points
	-Parent choose the things they want to discuss and the app lets them know when these things come up

-That connect parents to parenting tools
	-Local health resources and open houses
	-getting health services and health clinics
	-New parents and the importance of the first 3 years of developemnt
		-Early Childhood Development local chapters
		-Free museum park events
		-tips on activities and low cost outings
		-Visibility of a list of milestones for early childhood
	
-That provide students with learning tools for mathematics and science
	-After school programing nitiatives and groups
	-Connect students to tools like CodeAcademy, Khan academy etc
	-TO further understand and employ the Hole in the Wall, Child Driven education method (Developed by Sugata Mitra)
	
-A search database for scholarships based on student criteria
	-idea is that there are tons of financial resources and tools for higher ed that can aid poor communities
	-Tool that searches the web for scholarships and grants
		-Creates a list of requirements
		-Checks off requirements already met by the student
		-Sorts these scholarhips/grants by compatibility with student
		-Lets student know what things they are missing for full compatibility
		-Advices on deadlines and size of grants
		-Student can make a list of scholarships they are interested in
		-Student can add the deadlines and mile stones to completion to google calendar

-A canvasing tool that gets rid of clipboards and paperwork and informs canvasers of changes in real time!
	-Tool allow campaign head to create a new group to achieve the following:
	-Tool reads excel sheet containing name of constituent, address, phone number and voting location
	-Tool is connected to google maps
	-Tool allows for canvasing user to make teams
		-Canvaser clicks on the voting location
			-Tool returns a list of residents that can vote there and their info
			-Tool crosses off residents already contacted or that canvaser knows voted
			-All canvasers can see crossed off residents and residents left to contact
		-Canvaser can generate a walk map to visit constituents door to door
	-Tool returns usage data regarding how effective cavasing walks and calls were
	-All results can be saved at the end of campaign and downloaded
	-Local chater of group can keep the file and upload/view its contents whenver for next campaign
	

-A community tool to inform people about local events, block parties, etc
	(I really havent thought this one through the whole way. Many intracity communites lack cohesion or community identity. I want to target this)
